  	<p>
  	In today’s connected culture, audiences expect to see video everywhere they travel in the digital space and on every device they use. Unfortunately, the video products and services market is fragmented-  leaving media companies to piece together a roster of vendors to launch a profitable video strategy.  OneScreen serves our customers as an integration hub for many parts of the video ecosystem.  OneScreen’s 	adaptive technology solutions make it simple for publishers connect to where, when, and how their audience is watching with integrations for well-known and emerging platforms.</p>
